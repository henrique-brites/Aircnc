## **Air Code And Coffee** 

Application developed thinking about companies and developers. Making it possible for the developer to be able to schedule a day to get to know a company and its technologies and the companies that are available will give this space to share their experience and how the workplace works.

#### This application was developed at OmniStack Week, a course taught by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
